Market segments have been created since 1956 to
form groups in which individuals are as similar as possible to
each other, but dissimilar to other groups. The goal of this is
to make informed decisions and to be able to do effective and
focused marketing. In this project, we used clustering to develop
a prototype that groups AI Consultancy Services in Saarland
into market segments based on their size, their customers, their
industries and their end customers. This prototype is intended to
help AI Consultancy Services planning to establish a new location
in Saarland to identify the perfect location and to develop new
market segments
